marked abnormalities in both lungs are without gross change compared with . again noted is an apparent indwelling catheter with tip near the svc/ ra junction.
portable semi-erect chest radiograph at TIME is submitted.
"the endotracheal tube tip is 5 cm above the carina. the endogastric tube courses inferiorly out of field of view. a right-sided central venous catheter tip terminates at the upper-to-mid svc. the heart size is exaggerated by positioning and low lung volumes. mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. the lung volumes are low with bibasilar consolidations likely representing atelectasis. the aerated portions of the lung demonstrate pulmonary edema. there is no pneumothorax. overall, the appearance is similar to prior exam."

portable semi-erect chest radiograph at TIME is submitted.
"compared with the immediate prior study of , mild pulmonary edema has resolved. persistent heterogeneous opacification of the left base is most likely atelectasis related to low lung volumes. if infectious symptoms develop, repeat radiographs to assess for developing pneumonia are recommended. there is mild atelectasis at the right base. multiple, bilateral, old, well healed rib fractures are noted. there is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. the heart size is stably top-normal."

"bilateral chest tubes are present, both projecting over the region of the lung apices. endotracheal tube remains in standard position. orogastric tube is seen with tip coursing below the diaphragm, within the stomach, though the side port is above the gastroesophageal junction should be advanced by at least 5 cm. left subclavian catheter tip appears to be malpositioned, terminating at the region of the aortic knob, and is likely intra-arterial. remainder of the chest is unchanged. persistent dense consolidation within the retrocardiac region is noted with a moderate left hemothorax. there is continued oblong lucency overlying the cardiac silhouette compatible with a left pneumothorax. deep sulcus sign on the right is incompletely imaged, and compatible with a small right pneumothorax. multiple bilateral rib fractures are again seen."

"endotracheal tube, enteric tube, and right picc line are in satisfactory position. left lower lobe collapse persists. heterogeneous opacification of the right lung base has improved since the prior study, which may reflect redistribution of right pleural effusion secondary to upright position. the underlying heterogeneous parenchymal abnormality remains and is persistently concerning for pneumonia."
previously seen large right pleural effusion is now resolved. there is no consolidation or pneumothorax. cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal size. tortuous aortic contour is stable.
"three chest tubes are unchanged in position. no definite pneumothorax is identified. there has been improved aeration at the right base, likely due to improved atelectasis. a small amount of right pleural fluid remains, though has decreased since the prior exam. subcutaneous air along the right chest wall is likely from the recent chest tube insertions. there is mild left basilar atelectasis and a tiny left pleural effusion. since the prior exam, vascular congestion has slightly worsened. there is no evidence of pneumonia. no left pneumothorax is identified. the mediastinal contours are normal. the cardiac silhouette is significantly enlarged, and unchanged."

"rotated positioning. tracheostomy tube again noted. there is diffuse interstitial can alveolar edema, with moderate to moderately large left and small right effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. compared to the film from one day earlier, the appearances are overall similar. the chf findings may be very slightly worse and the left effusion is probably slightly larger."
"ap single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of . observed that a pa lateral chest examination was performed during this examination interval on with patient in upright position. at that time, existing air-fluid levels in the pleural space could not be assessed. again the previously described left-sided chest wall emphysema remains and makes identification of a possible remaining small pneumothorax in the left hemithorax impossible. the findings on the portable chest examinations are rather unchanged and there is a mild degree of left-sided mediastinal shift suggesting volume loss, atelectasis in the left-sided pulmonary changes. the right-sided hemithorax remains unremarkable with normal pulmonary vasculature and absence of any fluid accumulation in the right pleural sinus. no new infiltrates."

"the right chest tube remains in place. compared with the prior study, an oblong locule of air at the right lung apex is slightly larger. the large rind of fluid density along the right lung apex and upper right chest wall remains visible. on the current exam, this appearance suggests a relatively large hydropneumothorax around the right upper lung, with a width of approximately 2.7 cm, with associated slight depression of the apex of the lung itself. note is again made of parenchymal changes in the right lung apex, with chain sutures, and itb valves. the small right effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation is similar to the prior study. possible mild volume loss on the right, given suggestion of slight hyperinflation of left lung. apical changes in left lung are similar. no gross left lung effusion."

"in the right upper lobe there is an irregularly shaped pulmonary nodule measuring 1.5 x 1.1 cm, with subtle high-density regions, and centrally low density. hyperlucency at the left lung apex could represent a bulla or severe emphysematous change. diffuse interstitial opacities are likely in keeping with underlying parenchymal disease. no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia."

"a single portable ap semi-upright view of the chest was obtained. heart is mildly enlarged. calcifications are present in the aortic arch. deviation of the trachea to the right is probably due to an enlarged thyroid. there are diffuse bilateral opacities with perihilar distribution and more prominent in the lower zone, consistent with moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. moderate bilateral pleural effusions are also present. the degree of pulmonary edema limits assessment for focal consolidation. there is no pneumothorax."
