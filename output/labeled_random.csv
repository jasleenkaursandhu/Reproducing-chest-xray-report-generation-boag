"tracheostomy tube is midline. heart size is normal. low lung volumes are similar to prior exam, but there are new, mild bibasilar opacifications. on the right, this is most likely atelectasis. on the left, it is either atelectasis or pneumonia. no pneumothorax is seen. there may be small pleural effusions.",,,0.0,,1.0,,,-1.0,1.0,0.0,-1.0,,,1.0
